# Private, post-quantum secure transfer under EIP-8288

An interactive, step-by-step animation of a private transfer from a shielded pool under [EIP-8288](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8288) proof dependencies and [EIP-8141](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8141) frame transactions. It follows one transfer from the wallet's proof and frame transaction, through the pool's checks and the mempool, to the block, and shows how the program identity stays fixed while forks change the prover.

Open it at **https://soispoke.github.io/eip8288-private-transfer/**. Space plays or pauses, the arrow keys step through it, and each step has a spec note with the exact EIP rules it relies on.

The animation shows the program scheme proposed for EIP-8288's `0x11` in the accompanying post. Today's EIP-8288 text puts a verification key hash in that field instead.
